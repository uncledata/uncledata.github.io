    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I'm a data professional with a diverse journey that has taken me from a Data Analyst to a Data Engineer, leading teams as a Team Lead and Head of Data, and now I'm back to my roots as a Data Engineer. My career has been a quest for continuous improvement and a search for optimal solutions. I've been a problem solver, actively seeking opportunities for optimization and efficient architecture design.</p>
    <p>My skill set includes expertise in data pipelines, orchestration, SQL, and soft skills that allow me to lead, mentor, and communicate effectively. Beyond my professional life, I'm always curious and eager to embrace new challenges. I love working on side projects and experimenting with new technologies to stay up-to-date with the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
